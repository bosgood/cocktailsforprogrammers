A fishbowl drink. No one can tell you what's in it, yet by the end it has exactly what everyone needed.

Lots of straws required. The bartender cuts them to different lengths every time as every query is unique.

Some bars will implement this drink with a big pipeline that the barback(end) uses to dump stuff into the glass.
