You must describe exactly what you want in your drink. If any of the ingredients are already in another patron's drink, you must point to the patron instead of naming that ingredient.

The bartender, however, will _never_ screw up your order. Not even a tiny bit. Ever.

It is, however, weirdly incompatible with the Object-Relational Margarita, which is made out of ingredients from other drinks that are all aged, smoked, tinted, blended, and infused to taste like entirely different ingredients.
